I built this React application to practice retrieving data from third-party APIs using fetch and axios web requests, and then to render the data. 

I'm using this database:

https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#animals

So if this looks like someone set up a React app that assembles a bunch of random data components retrieved from various APIs, that's...exactly what this is, for now. 

Did you know that there's a Random Fox API? I'm trying to figure out a way to use it in an actual application. You try: 

https://randomfox.ca/floof/

The to-do list is something like:

1) Establish working fetch request(s)
2) Establish working axios request(s)
3) Render data in components imported into the App file
4) Separate into data vs. formatting components
5) Play around with CSS styling options in React
6) Play around with visual data presentation, e.g. graphs, pie charts
7) Play around with API abstraction

Eventually, I'd also like to:
8) Fool around with React Router to create multiple page views for this FrankenAPI (we got yer foxes, we got yer bhagavad-vita couplets, we got yer up-to-the-minute COVID-19 data...). Also make some buttons and logic toggles so that users can show "most recent NASA photos" OR "five random NASA photos"
9) API abstraction might belong here

Installation info:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
